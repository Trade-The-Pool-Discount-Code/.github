## 🚀 What is Trade The Pool?

Trade The Pool, operating under the legal name Five Percent Online LTD and headquartered in Israel, is the world's leading proprietary trading firm built exclusively for U.S. stock and ETF traders. Founded in 2022 by CEO Michael Katz — a seasoned professional with over 17 years of experience in stock and futures trading who previously headed traders at a major institutional prop firm — Trade The Pool was created with a single, clear purpose: to give skilled equity traders real access to real capital in the real U.S. stock market.

What makes Trade The Pool genuinely unique in the prop trading landscape is its singular focus on U.S. equities and ETFs. While virtually every other prop firm channels traders into forex or CFD simulations, Trade The Pool is built on actual exchange data from NASDAQ, NYSE, and CBOE, with execution backed by Interactive Brokers — one of the most respected and regulated prime brokers in the world. Traders access over 12,000 tradable symbols including stocks, ETFs, and penny stocks, with real exchange spreads and no hidden mark-ups on pricing. Account sizes range from $2,000 to $200,000 in buying power, with a clear scaling plan that can grow total allocated capital all the way up to $450,000. Profit splits start at 70% and rise to 80% on larger accounts, with bi-weekly payouts processed consistently within 1 to 3 business days.
